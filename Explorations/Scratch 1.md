## Extension

**Add other sprites** - Reproduce the same code using other sprites that can tell us other facts when they are clicked!  

* **Download an image from the internet and use it as a sprite**

* Use **google image** to look for pictures of other animals or characters (**right-click, save image as**). 

* Use the **Tools** section of the google image search bar to filter pictures by **Usage rights**, select Labeled for reuse
        
        TIP
        Look for images using “white background” as part of your search to find images that will be easier to edit.
        Go back to the Scratch interface, click on the sprite icon and select Upload Sprite
