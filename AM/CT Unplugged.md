# CT Unplugged

## The Programmer game

**Recommended grade level:** Teachers and students all levels

**Recommended duration:** 15 min

**Learning objectives:** 
* Familiarity with the creation of a program
* Familiarity with the programming concept of sequencing

**Materials:**
* [Download and print the programming table and cards](/assets/images/pdf/CT_Unplugged.pdf)
* Ping pong ball or another object
* Eye mask (optional)

## Introduction 

This introductory game invites each group of participants to experience what is like **being a programmer** by giving simple instructions to a Robot. The Robot has to be guided from a starting point to a final goal. 

The Programmer can use only a simple set of instructions or cards which can be written on the **programming table**. The Program can be iterated by finding the number of repetitions to make it shorter and more efficient.

## Preparation

Divide the participants in groups (3-6 participants per group)

Each team: 
1. Picks a **programmer**, a **scribe** and a **robot** 

2. Defines a starting point and a destination (10-15 ft)

3. Place few obstacles along the way

## Game
> Explain simply but in detail the ‘Programmer Game’

* The **programmer** guides the robot from starting point to destination using the minimal amount of steps with 3 types of commands ( **start + advance + turn**). 

* A maximum **10 instructions** can be given to reach the goal.

* The **scribe** logs the instructions on the programming table using the pictograms and the repetitions cards.

* The **robot** executes the instructions.

## Reflection

When the game is done the team can go over the programming table and identify if they can make the algorithm even shorter.

	TEACHING NOTES & DISCUSSIONS 
	* How hard was to guide the Robot to the objective? 
    * Were the instructions clear enough?
	* Are these set of instructions used daily on your phone?
