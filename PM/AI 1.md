## Create a safe password

**Learning Objectives:**
* Understanding what a password is and why it is important 
* Ability to create a strong password and store it properly

**Recommended duration:** 30 min

**Materials:** Computer or a pen and paper

**Theme:** Security online 

**Warm-up discussion**

> **Ask:** What personal information should be kept private?
Students think in pairs, note down their ideas and share their answers with the class. e.g., - conversations with your friends, your diary, your phone number, your home address  

**Explain:**  One way of protecting an information is by restricting who can access it.

> **Ask:** Think about a phone or computer that contains private information or conversation. How do you limit who can access it? 

**Explain:** One of the most common ways to protect your personal information online is by using a password. It is a string of letters and numbers that allows access to your online information, like emails. Some passwords, however, are stronger than others because they are harder for someone to figure out. 

**Activity**

> This activity can be done on a computer in an electronic document or offline using pen and paper.

**1.** Pick an animal, a number and a special character like: * _ # - &: 
e.g., 2, horse and *

**2.** Create a very simple sentence containing the animal and the number
e.g., 2 horses eat chips

**3.** Capitalize the first letter of your sentence
e.g., 2 Horses eat chips

**4.** Replace some of the spaces in your sentence with your special character 
e.g., 2*Horseseatchips

**5.** Memorize your password by repeating it a few times and writing it on your paper or with the keyboard if on a computer 

**Reflection**
> Ask: Who should have access to your password? 

Just yourself? Your parents? Your teachers? (Scratch account)

        NOTE
        To store it memorize it, 
        don’t write it on the same paper as your email or 
        login and the platform it is used for. 

**Explain:** As you get older, having a strong password will become even more important. You will use it to restrict access to your bank accounts, email, online profiles, student account, etc...

## Circle of privacy

**Learning Objectives:**
* Familiarity with the concepts of privacy online and respect of others' privacy
* Understand the importance of personal information and privacy settings online for yourself and others

**Recommended duration:** 30 min

**Materials:** Computer or a pen and paper

**Theme:** Security online 

**Warm-up discussion**

> **Ask:** Have you ever seen photos of you or one of your friends online? If so, where? Have you shared pictures or video online? On what platform? Have you ever had someone share a picture of you without your permission? How did you feel about that? 

        NOTE
        it is important to create a safe space for your students 
        to be able to share their experiences

**Activity**

> Draw 5 concentric circles on the white board 

<img src="./assets/images/pm-ai-dc/AI-DC.png" width="100%">

Ask class to place each sentence in the circle representing who can access this information: 

* A picture or a video on my phone - Me and my friends I show it to
* A picture in the local paper - My community
* A video on national television - The country
* A video on a private YouTube channel/ Instagram account - Me and my friends
* A video on a public YouTube channel/instagram account - The world

**Reflection**

Online accounts can be private or public. When on private setting, you can control who sees what you share. Be mindful of the fact that accounts are usually set by default on public mode and it is up to you to modify the privacy settings. 

Also when you post something online, there is a chance it is never going to disappear. You might be ok with sharing something today but may not be comfortable with it in the future.

## Private vs. personal information

**Learning Objectives:**
* Familiarity with the concepts of private information and why it is important to keep them private
* Learn to respect other people's privacy online while sharing content

**Materials:** Whiteboard

**Theme:** Security online 

**Warm-up discussion**

>  **Ask:** what is the difference between personal and private information? 

Ask students to share in pairs and ask volunteers to share examples with the class.

Personal information includes:  your taste, the food you like, your hobbies 

Private information includes: home address, full name, phone number everything that can identify you personally 

**Activity**
Draw 3 columns on the board:

<!-- <img src="./assets/images/pm-ai-info/info.png" width="100%"> -->

| OK TO SHARE ONLINE | SOMETIMES OK TO SHARE ONLINE | NEVER OK TO SHARE ONLINE |
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|

Ask students to place each following information in the appropriate column: 

* Home address - never ok 
* Full name - never ok
* Date of birth - never ok 
* Passwords  - never ok
* Email address - sometimes ok (share it with someone you can trust)
* Phone number - never ok
* What I like to eat - ok to share online
* Cool vacation picture - ok to share online 
* The picture or video of my friends - sometimes ok (if you ask their permission)

**Reflection**

Apps and websites might ask for your private information, like your date of birth and your full name for advertisement purposes, meaning the are using this information to try to sell more products to you. (e.g., Email you with a special offer on your birthday)

While chatting with strangers online and in real life, it is important to keep sensitive information private. Otherwise they might be able to trick you or put you in uncomfortable situations (like coming to your home uninvited).

## Screen time diary

**Learning Objectives:**
* Reflect on screen time and online habits
* Develop healthy habits and strategies around screen time management 

**Materials:** Computer or a pen and paper

**Theme:** Security online 

**Warm-up discussion**

> Have you ever kept a diary? What do you do after school? Have you ever thought about how much time you spend online each day?

        NOTE
         it is important to create a safe space for your students 
         to share their experiences

**Activity**

Ask students to reproduce these 5 columns in their notebook and log all activities in front of a screen for a week or month, including activities done at school:

<!-- <img src="./assets/images/pm-ai-st/AI-ST-1.png" width="100%"> -->

| WHAT | WHEN | HOW LONG | WITH WHOM | HOW DID IT MAKE YOU FEEL |
|------|------|----------|-----------|--------------------------|

Explain each column: 

* What: what were you doing? (watching a video, watching TV, playing a video game)
* When: when was it ? (after school before dinner, after dinner)
* How long: how much time? (20 min )
* With whom: who were you with (your parents, your sister, brother, friends, alone)
* How did it make you feel: watching a funny cat videos can make you feel happy. 
* Playing video games can make you feel frustrated. Watching a scary video can make you feel afraid

**Reflection** 

It is important to take a step back and check emotions when engaging with technology because a lot of these platforms are built to capture our attention and it is easy to get lost into them and spend more time on it than we would like. 

e.g., Are you watching YouTube because you feel sad and want a good laugh? Do you want to relax by playing a video game that gives you a fun challenge? 

Timing yourself and checking your emotions are two great strategies to make sure you are not missing out on other parts of life and getting the most out of your online experience.
