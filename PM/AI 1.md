# AI Digital Citizenship

> Extra Activities

After receiving the AI workshop in your classroom, you can follow up and reinvest what youâ€™ve learned with these fun and engaging activities around online privacy and digital citizenship. 
These lessons are designed to help students develop safe online habits, maintain a healthy relationship with their screen time and protect their digital privacy. Each lesson starts with a short class discussion to introduce the key concepts. Activities can be done offline. Finally, the lessons ends with a short wrap-up discussion.  
Lessons are independent from one another and can be done over the course of a few days or a few weeks (one activity a week for exemple).
