# Computational Thinking Unplugged
> Can you write instructions that are clear enough for a computer to understand?

**Recommended grade level:** Teachers and students of all levels

**Recommended duration:** 15 minutes

**Learning objectives:**
* Develop familiarity with the creation of a program
* Develop familiarity with the programming concept of sequencing and algorithms
* To create clear and specific algorithms to perform a task or 'computation'

**Materials:**
* Popsicle sticks/pencils/stones (or any objects of similar size)
* Paper
* Markers

## Introduction 
> The Architect Game

This unplugged activity invites participants to experience what it is like **to be a computer programmer** by giving simple instructions to recreate an image. The instructions have to be as clear and simple as possible in order to reproduce an accurate design made of popsicle sticks.

## Game Instructions

**1.** Divide students into teams of 2-4 people.

**2.** Give each team 5 sticks. You can add more sticks or other materials to increase the difficulty.

**3.** Pair two teams together: Team A and Team B.

**4.** Team A will work together to create a design with their sticks

> They should **not show** their design to the other team.


**5.** Without showing their design, Team A must give clear instructions to Team B to recreate their design.

> For example, “Place 3 sticks in a straight line from left to right.”

**6.** Team A invite team to see if Team B the design they created is accurate. 

**7.** **When Team B’s design matches Team A’s, it’s time to switch roles.**

<strong>Notes</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The team who gives instructions first, cannot point or demonstrate when they give instructions. They can only use words.</li>
		<li>Warn students ahead of time that the other team might not follow the instructions correctly.</li>
		<li>If this happens, teams can give  new instructions.</li>
		<li>A player from the team giving instructions will write down the instructions that work.</li>
	</ul>

## Reflection
* Was it easy or challenging to give instructions?
* What were some of the challenges?
* In real life, what are some instructions that require measurements?
* What would happen if these instructions were not clear enough?
* When we give instructions, what do we need to do to ensure they lead to the desired result?
