## Architect Game
> To give instructions to create an image

**Recommended grade level:** Teachers and students all levels

**Recommended duration:** 15 min

**Learning objectives:** 
* Familiarity with the creation of a program
* Familiarity with the programming concept of sequencing
* To create clear and specific algorithms to meet a goal

**Materials:**
* Sticks/pencils/stones (or any objects of similar size)
* Flipchart paper
* Scrap paper
* Markers

### Introduction 

This introductory game invites each group of participants to experience what is like **being a programmer** by giving simple instructions to create an image. The instructions have to be as clear as possible to be able to create an acurate image made with wooden sticks.

### Game

1. Divide the tables into 2 groups (2-4 participants per group) on each side of the table. Group A and Group B.

2. Invite each team to take 2 pages of flipchart paper, markers and 5-6 sticks.

3. Explain and demonstrate that:
	* Each team will work together to create a design with their sticks and draw it on a piece of scrap paper (see examples below).
	* They should not show their design to the other teams.

3. Explain and demonstrate that:
	* Teams should not show their designs to one another.
	* Team A will clearly instruct Team B to create their design. For example, **“Place 3 sticks in a straight line from left to right.”**
	* Team A **cannot point or demonstrate when they give instructions. They can only use words.**
	* Team B might not follow the instructions correctly. If this happens, Team A can discuss ideas and try a new instruction.
	* As they give instructions, **a player from Team A will write down the instructions that work.**
	* When the design is complete, it is Team B’s turn to give instructions and write down the instructions.
6. Explain that each team has created instructions. They will give their written instructions to a new team (Team C) to follow.
7. Invite teams to see if Team C could create the design.


### Reflection

* Was it easy or challenging to give instructions?
* What were some of the challenges?
* In real life, what are some instructions that say the exact measurements to use?
* What would happen if these instructions were not clear enough?
* When we create instructions, what do we need to check for to make sure they lead to the right result?

		TEACHING NOTES
		* Are all players able to share ideas and participate?
    	* Can players give clear and effective instructions?
		* Are players becoming frustrated?


## Robot Game
> To give instructions to meet a goal

**Recommended grade level:** Teachers and students all levels

**Recommended duration:** 15 min

**Learning objectives:** 
* Familiarity with the creation of a program
* Familiarity with the programming concept of sequencing
* To create clear and specific algorithms to meet a goal

**Materials:**
* [Download and print the programming table and cards](/assets/images/pdf/CT_Unplugged.pdf)
* Ping pong ball or another object
* Eye mask (optional)

### Introduction 

This introductory game invites each group of participants to experience what is like **being a programmer** by giving simple instructions to a Robot. The Robot has to be guided from a starting point to a final goal. 

The Programmer can use only a simple set of instructions or cards which can be written on the **programming table**. The Program can be iterated by finding the number of repetitions to make it shorter and more efficient.

### Game
![](/assets/images/am-unplugged/signs.png)

**1.** Divide the participants in groups (3-6 participants per group)

**2.** Each team: Picks a **programmer**, a **scribe** and a **robot** 

**3.** Define a starting point and a destination (10-15 ft)

**4.** Place few obstacles along the way 

**5.** The **programmer** guides the robot from starting point to destination using the minimal amount of steps with 3 types of commands ( **start + advance + turn**). 

**6.** A maximum **10 instructions** can be given to reach the goal.

**7.** The **scribe** logs the instructions on the programming table using the pictograms and the repetitions cards.

**8.** The **robot** executes the instructions.

### Reflection

* How hard was to guide the Robot to the objective? 
* Were the instructions clear enough?
* Are these set of instructions used daily on your phone?

	TEACHING NOTES
	* Identify if they can make the algorithm even shorter
