# MB Intro

**Recommended grade level:**: grades 3 - 9+

**Recommended duration:**: 15 min.

**Learning Objectives:**
* Familiarity with the microbit environment
* Familiarity with the programming concept of sequencing  
* Similarities in Visual Block Coding between Scratch and Micro:bit platforms


**Materials:**: Makecode platform

## Makecode Platform Intro  (5 min.)
> Introduction of the MakeCode Interface and its similarities with Scratch.

##### The Makecode Platform main interface

    NOTES
    * The Simulator allows to program without any physical device connected.


## Makecode platform code example (10 min.)
> Comments on some simple code to see how easy is to work with.

##### Similarities between Scratch and Microbit going through a simple example.

1. Introduce the **On start** event and play with the show LEDs block.

##### Use the LEDs block to show how to draw with lights

2. Introduce the events on **button A, B or AB is pressed**

##### Use the 3 different button variations as an example of physical inputs

3. Introduce the gyroscope sensor using the on shake function

##### Use the sensor on shake to see the gyroscope in action

    NOTES
    * Both platforms have similar basic programming secrtions
    * The sensors sections are the main difference between both platforms
    * Examples to show:
        * Chuck the Duck for radio communication
        * Step Counter for using a sensor


## Reflection
* Do you understand properly the main differences between both platforms?
* Why would you choose one over the other in your classes?

## Examples 
* [Chuck the Duck Code]()
* [Step counter Code]()
