## Introduction 
> Explain simply but in detail the ‘Guide the Robot’ Game

This introductory game invites each group of participants to experience writing their first program by giving simple instructions to a Robot. The Robot has to be guided from a starting point to a final goal. The Programmer can use only a simple set of instructions or cards which can be written on the **programming table**. The Program can be iterated by finding the number of repetitions to make it shorter and more efficient.

## Game
> Play the game
* Divide the participants by table groups (3-6 participants per group).
* Guide the Robot from the Starting Point to a close objective (10-15 ft).
* Roles: 
	* 1 Robot
	* 1 Programmer giving instructions
	* 1 Writer writing down instructions on the programming table
* Give a ‘Program Table’ with 3 instructions to fill ( start + advance + turn ) or cards
* Maximum 10 instructions can be given to reach the goal
## Reflection
	* How hard was to guide the Robot to the objective? 
    * Where the instructions clear enough?
	* Do these set of instructions remind you something normally used on your phone?
	* How often do you use these kind of instructions to move daily?
