# AI Unplugged

**Recommended grade level:** 4-8

**Recommended duration:** 15 min

**Learning objectives:** 
* Familiarity with computational practices like abstraction and decomposition
* Familiarity with AI computer vision (object description by physical characteristics and not usage)

**Materials:**
* [Object cards - Downlod]()
* [Category cards: texture, color, size, shape  - Downlod](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1FdDRLu3wv54M1CdGOsEGBvaN4g9ATNPe)

## Game
> Use a card game to introduce the concept of computer vision.

**1.**  Divide the class into four groups. 

**2.**  One volunteer steps outside of the classroom. 

**3.**  Each group receives one pile of category cards (shape, color, texture, size).

**4.**  Ask a second volunteer to pick a secret object card and show it to class.

**4.**  Each group picks two category cards from their pile.

**4.**  The cards must describe the object the best. 

**7.**  Collect the remaining cards from each group. 

## Extension 1
> Easy version
* Randomly select five other object cards to which the secret object card previously selected by the volunteer will be added.
* Invite volunteers back in the class and give them the category cards selected by the class.
* The volunteer chooses which of the 6 objects fits best with the selected category cards. 


## Extension 2
> Challenging version
* Give the volunteer the category cards selected by the class. 
* The volunteer guess which object is best described by the selected category cards.
