## Introduction

#### Microbit properly connected with the Art:bit via Bluetooth

Art:bit is a friendly block-coding platform for micro:bit specifically created for storytelling and art. Getting started is easy:

**1.** Simply draw your shapes on the right-hand side of the screen (shape section)

**2.** Select the shape you drew

**3.** It will be automatically displayed on your micro:bit.


**The Shape section**

Here is how to create, erase, move and duplicate shapes in the art:bit interface.

## Storytelling with Shapes
>Three-shape story : Introduction to digital story-telling.

**1.** In the **Shape** section: Draw three shapes. ***Ex: A person, the moon, and a rocket***

**2.** Invent a story featuring these three shapes. ***Ex: I dream of becoming an astronaut and traveling to the moon.***

        TEACHING NOTE
        This activity can be introduced in an unplugged manner using graph paper.
        Each student:
        1. outlines three 5x5 grids on their sheet of graph 
        2. imagines their 3-image story and draws the shapes to go with it


## Code your story
> Digitize the three-shape story.

<img src="./assets/images/pm-ab1/4.png" width="100%">

* From the **Events** section, drag each one of the blocks **When A pressed**, **When B pressed**, and **When A&B pressed** into the coding area. 
* From the **Lights** section, add the **set shape** block under each one of the Event blocks and change the number to that of the corresponding shape you want to display.
* Trigger your story by pressing the buttons A, B or A&B on the micro:bit.

## Animate each shape
> Turn each shape into a looped animation.

**Going from a single shape to a two-shape animation sequence.**

> Create the shapes you need for the animation: in the **Shapes** area:

**1.** Duplicate shape 1  using the stamp tool and place it side by side with the first shape. Repeat for image 2 and  image 3. 

**2.** Update the duplicates (second column) to create an animation.

Write the code you need to animate your first two shapes. 


> Working in the coding area with the **When A pressed** sequence:

**1.** From the **Lights** section, drag the **set shape** block into the coding area and add it below the **set shape 1** block. Update the number to “2”. 

**2.** From the **Control** section, drag the **Repeat** block into the coding area and place it around the **set shape 1**  and **set shape 2** blocks (under the **When A pressed** block). 

**3** Update the number for the number of repetitions you would like your animation to go for.

**4.** Test your animation by pressing the A button on your micro:bit! 

Write the code to animate your other two shapes by repeating the steps and changing the values to correspond to the shapes you are working with.

## Exension
> Shake up the story with randomization

<img src="./assets/images/pm-ab1/7.png" width="100%">

**1.** Delete the code under the **When A pressed** block.

**2.** From the **Lights** section, drag a **set shape** block and add it under the **When A pressed** block.

**3.** From the **Operators** section drag the **pick random** block and put it inside the **set shape** block. 

**4.** Change the numbers in the **pick random** block so that they correspond to the range of shapes you want the micro:bit to pick between.
Test your code!
