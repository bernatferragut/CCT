## Introduction

#### To start this activity, ensure that the micro:bit is properly connected to the Art:bit app via Bluetooth

Art:bit is a friendly block-coding platform for micro:bit, specifically created for storytelling and making art. Getting started is easy:

**1.** Draw your shape on the right-hand side of the screen (shape section)

**2.** Select the shape you drew by clicking on it

**3.** Your shape will now appear on your micro:bit.


**Drawing Shapes using Art:bit**

Here is how to create, erase, move and duplicate shapes in the Art:bit interface.

## Storytelling with Shapes
>TThree-shape story : Introduction to digital story-telling.

**1.** In the **Shape** section: Draw three shapes. ***Ex: A person, the moon, and a rocket***

**2.** Invent a story featuring these three shapes. ***Ex: I dream of becoming an astronaut and traveling to the moon.***

<strong>Notes</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>This activity can be introduced as an unplugged component using a graph paper for each student</li>
	<li>outlines three 5x5 grids on their sheet of graph paper</li>
        <li>imagines their 3-image story and draws the shapes to go with it</li>
	</ul>
</div>

## Code your story
> Digitize the three-shape story.

<img src="./assets/images/pm-ab1/4.png" width="100%">

* From the **Events** section, drag a **When A pressed** block, a **When B pressed** block, and a **When A&B pressed** block into the coding area.
* From the **Lights** section, add the **set shape** block under each one of the **Event** blocks and change the number to the corresponding shape you want to display.
* Trigger your story by pressing the **buttons A, B or A&B** on the micro:bit.

## Animate each shape
> Turn each shape into a looped animation.

**Going from a single shape to a two-shape animation sequence.**

> Create the shapes you need for the animation in the **Shapes** area:

**1.** Duplicate shape 1 using the **stamp tool** and place it next to the first shape. Repeat for shape 2 and shape 3.

**2.** Update the duplicates (in the second column) to create an animation.

Write the code you need to animate your first two shapes.


> Working in the coding area with the **When A pressed** sequence:

**1.** From the **Lights** section, drag a **set shape** block into the coding area and add it below the set **shape 1** block. Update the number to “2”.

**2.** From the **Control** section, drag a **Repeat** block into the coding area and place it around the **set shape 1** and **set shape 2** blocks (under the **When A pressed** block).

**3.** Change the number for the number of repetitions to 10.

**4.** Test your animation by pressing the **A button** on your micro:bit!

**5.** Write the code to animate your other two shapes by repeating the previous steps and changing the shape number to correspond to the one you want to animate.

## Exension
> Shake up the story with randomization

<img src="./assets/images/pm-ab1/7.png" width="100%">

**1.** Delete the code under the **When A** pressed block.

**2.** From the **Lights** section, drag a **set shape** block and add it under the **When A pressed** block.

**3.** From the **Operators** section drag a **pick random** block and put it inside the **set shape** block.

**4.** Change the number in the **pick random** block so that they correspond to the range of shapes you want to display on the micro:bit. Test your code by pressing **A**!
