# Scratch Presentation <span style="color:orange;font-size:1.5rem;">BEGINNER</span>

**Learning Objectives:**
* Create an interactive presentation on a subject of your choice using Scratch. - [GLOBAL GOALS LINK](https://kidscodejeunesse.org/global-goals)
* Introduction to storytelling using Scratch
* Develop familiarity with the Scratch environment 

**Recommended grade level:** grades 3 - 9

**Recommended duration:** 45 min

**Materials:** Scratch 3.0

**Warm-up**
* You can get started by choosing a unit from any subject that you have recently taught or are currently teaching your students. For example, ancient egypt in history, Frida Khalo in art or the arctic tundra in geography. - [GET INSPIRATION](http://www.hww.ca/en/ )
* Once you have chosen your unit, brainstorm some fun and interesting facts with your students that you will then illustrate with characters in your project in Scratch (ex: Polar bears have translucent hair and black skin to absorb and preserve body heat).- [GET INSPIRATION](http://www.hww.ca/en/)

* Change the text - Type in one of your fun facts! **Ex: My fur is transparent!**

* You are done! Test your code by clicking on your sprite.

## Extension

**Add other sprites** - Reproduce the same code using other sprites that can tell us other facts when they are clicked!  

* **Download an image from the internet and use it as a sprite**

* Use **google images** to look for pictures of other animals or characters (**right-click, save image as, upload to Scratch**). 

* Use the **Tools** section of the google image search bar to filter pictures by **Usage rights**, select Labeled for reuse
        
        TIP
        Look for images using “white background” as part of your search to find images that will be easier to edit.
        Go back to the Scratch interface, click on the sprite icon and select Upload Sprite 
	

* Go back to the Scratch interface, click on the **sprite icon** and select **Upload Sprite**
