## Game
> Use a card game to introduce the concept of artificial intelligence and computer vision.

**1.** Separate the cards into piles: object, colour, size, texture, shape.

**2.** Ask a volunteer, **the Guesser**, to step outside of the classroom.

**3.** Ask another volunteer to pick 1 card from the object pile. Show the card, **the Object**, to the class.

**4.** Divide the rest of the class into 4 groups. Each group receives one pile of cards: shape, colour, texture, size.

**5.** Each team picks 1 or 2 cards that best describes **the Object**.

**6.** Invite **the Guesser** back into the room and show them the cards selected by the teams.

**7.** **The Guesser** has to identify **the Object** and is allowed to ask as many questions as needed about the cards. For example: what do you mean by a prickly texture?

However, they are not allowed to ask about what **the Object** is used for, or where it is most often seen.

**8.** After 5 minutes if **the Guesser** has not identified **the Object**, they are allowed to ask questions about the location of the Object (e.g would we find this object in a home? In a kitchen?). The class is still not allowed to talk about what **the Object** is used for.

## Easier version

To make the game easier you can pre-select **5 Object cards** that **the Guesser** has to choose from.

* So what would a teacher say to a group of students? Are they emulating what a computer is doing to classify an image? 

* What role is the guesser playing if this was a real AI system... are they the AI?
