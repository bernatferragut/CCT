# AI Intro
> How can an AI system see the world?

**Learning objectives:** 
* Devlop familiarity with AI thinking 
* Identifying the different parts of training an AI :
* from building a data set of examples to testing the AI 

## 5 human senses
> How do babies learn what forks are: 5 human senses
<!-- ##### What is a fork? -->

    NOTES:
    * As kids, we learn to use a fork with our 5 senses
    * That way we experience the function of a fork

## Collect examples
> Let’s teach an AI what a fork is.  The first step would be to collect examples and identify forks in various images.

    NOTES:
    To teach computers how to recognize a fork:   
    An AI trainer gathers a very large collection of examples (data set)
    This data set of images contains forks manually identified 
    The more examples we have the better the AI will work

## Input examples in your model
> Input examples and counter examples to train your model

    NOTES:
    * The AI trainer puts the collection of examples in the AI system.
    * The AI system can build a model of  what the forks look like from different angles.
    * The AI trainer puts another collection of counter examples of objects that are not forks.
    * That way the AI can see the difference between what a fork looks like and what a fork doesn’t look like.

## Test your model
> Test your model with another example, i.e. - a spoon

    NOTES:
    * The AI trainer runs a test to ensure the fork model works well and the AI is able to identify the images of forks.
    * We ask the AI if this image (the spoon) is a fork or not.

## Recap
> To problem solve with AI, build a model of what a fork looks like

    NOTES:
    * During the training, the AI found a common pattern in all of the images of forks.
    * The AI system built an internal model of what a fork looks like.

## Using AI
> Use your AI: identify a fork pattern!

    NOTES:
    * During the test, the AI takes an image and analyses it 
    to identify if a fork is included. 
    It starts by detecting the edges and identifying the pattern of a fork. 

## Machine Learning
> Machine learning is a technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: **learn from experience.**

## Why is it so much work?
> Because your brain is really good at building models of objects
![](./assets/images/am-ai-intro/AI_Intro_Slides_9.png)

Your brain is really good at building models for objects and identifying them even if not all the parts of the objects are visible

## Self-driving cars
> Some things are obvious for us but remain difficult for AI

### CAN DO
* Identify the position of other cars

### CAN'T DO
* Differentiate hand signs between stop, hitchhikers or bike turning


## X-ray diagnosis
> AI flourishes with the input of large and high quality sets of data.

### CAN DO
* Identify pneumonia from 10 000 labeled images

### CAN'T DO
* Identify pneumonia from 10 images, a textbook chapter and a few clinical cases
