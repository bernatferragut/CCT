# AI Intro

**Recommended grade level:** 4-8

**Recommended duration:** 20 min

**Materials**: Facilitator computer with smartboard/projector/monitor

**Learning objectives:** 
* Familiarity with AI thinking 
* Identifying the different parts of training an AI :
    * from building a data set of examples to testing the AI 

## AI 101
> AI: Can we get an AI to see the world?


## 5 human senses
> How do babies learn what forks are: 5 human senses
##### What is a fork?

    NOTES:
    * As kids, we learn to use a fork with our 5 senses
    * That way we experience the function of a fork

## Collect examples
> Let’s teach an AI what a fork is: collect examples and identify forks in images
##### Teaching an AI system

    NOTES:
    * To teach computers how to recognize a fork:   
        * An AI trainer gathers a very large collection of examples (data set)
        * This data set of images contains forks manually identified 
    * The more examples we have the better the AI will work

## Input example in your model
> Input examples and counter example to train your model
##### Feeding the AI system with examples

    NOTES:
    * The AI trainer puts the collection of examples in the AI system.
    * The AI system can build a model of  what the forks look like from different angles.
    * The AI trainer puts another collection of counter examples of objects that are not forks.
    * That way the AI can see the difference between what a fork looks like and what a fork doesn’t look like.

## Test your model
> Test your model with another example, here a spoon 
##### Testing the AI system % of confidence

    NOTES:
    * The AI trainer runs a test to ensure the fork model works well and the AI is able to identify the images of forks.
    * We ask the AI if this image (the spoon) is a fork or not.

## Recap
> To problem solve with AI, build a model of what a fork looks like
##### Building the model

    NOTES:
    * During the training, the AI found a common pattern in all of the images of forks.
    * The AI system built an internal model of what a fork looks like.

## Using AI
> Use your AI: identify a fork pattern!

##### Building the model

    NOTES:
    * During the test the AI takes an image and analyses it to identify if a fork is included. It starts by detecting the edges and identifying the pattern of a fork. 

## Machine Learning
> Machine learning is a technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: **learn from experience.**

## Why is it so much work?
> Because your brain is really good at building models of objects

##### We have an amazing brain

Your brain is really good at building models for objects and identifying them even if not all the parts of the objects are visible
