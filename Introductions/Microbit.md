# Micro:bit Intro

## What is a Micro:bit?
>The BBC micro:bit is a mini-computer that can be programmed to do almost any task! It has a built-in accelerometer, radio transmitter, 5 by 5 LED display and two programmable buttons. 

Powered by a battery pack or by USB, the micro:bit is a powerful tool used to teach programming in a fun and interactive way.

Anything from a digital basketball game to passing secret messages or creating a musical instrument is possible with this device that fits in the palm of your hand.

There are hundreds of activities to choose from that allows for an easy integration of computational thinking into any subject. The options with micro:bit are limitless.

    TEACHER NOTES
    * Introduce the MakeCode Interface and show its similarities with Scratch
    * Similarites: block palette, simulator - stage, coding area

## MakeCode platform code example
> Open this makecode example and use the simulator to see the results

    TEACHER NOTES
    * Live code slowly
    * Encourage people to go on the platform and test the code themselves

## Download your Program
**1.** Connect your micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.

**2.** The micro:bit will show up as a drive called **micro:bit**

**3.** On the Makecode platform, after creating your code, press the **Download** button in order to save your code.

    <source src="/assets/images/videos/A.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

**4.** Save it as a .hex file, which is a format that the micro:bit can understand.
Locate the downloaded file and drag it to the 'micro:bit' drive to upload your code to the micro:bit.

**5.** Now you're ready to use your micro:bit! You can keep uploading new .hex files onto your micro:bit but each time you upload a new program the old one is deleted as the micro:bit can only store one .hex file at a time.
Note: The micro:bit can only store .hex files and will reject any other type of file that it receives.



## Reflection
* Do you understand the main differences between both the Scratch and MakeCode platforms?
* Why would you choose one over the other in your class projects?
