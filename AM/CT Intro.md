# CT Intro


## Definition
> The thinking we do when we formulate something - like a problem or creative work - clearly enough and systematically enough that we could tell a computer - or a human - how to do it.

* Computational thinking takes a classical philosophical question and applied to our modern world where we live and interact with computers daily.
* From the classic Greeks, Al-Kwarizhmi, Llull, Descartes, Newton and Leibniz to Allan Turing.
* The 4 Pillars are in no specific order.

## Decomposition
> To reduce a complex problem into more simple pieces

* Use the path of least resistance. 
* Start with what you know and the rest of connections will unfold naturally.
* Trying to solve 'everything' at the same time produce a mental shortcircuit.

## Pattern Recognition
> To learn how to identify what is similar to: simplify, reduce and apply similar solutions to problems

* What it’s been repeated several times in this sequence?
* Allows us to simplify the problem into a more precise one. 
* Gives birth to language through an agreement.
* Connected to **memory**: it’s necessary to be able to recognize.

## Abstraction
> To reduce something complex to the most essential useful characteristics

* The least obvious of all of them. 
* To find what is fundamental takes time and effort. 
* Only practice makes you better at what is essential in something.
* It’s today’s data. Data is the new Oil. Very important for AI.

## Algorithms
> A step by step list or sequence of instructions

* The world of recipes, lists and daily actions.
* We all live in our ‘daily algorithm’.
* Slowly we make algorithms better and better.

## House Example

* How would you explain to your class CT in a simple way? 
* Through the act of 'drawing' you can include all your students in the learning.

## Text Challenge 
> If today is Friday,what is the day after the day before the day before tomorrow?

![](/assets/images/am-ct-intro/CT_Intro_Slides_7.png)
* Apply Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction and Algorithmic thinking.
* Explain your experience problem solving this question.

## Where is CT?
> Can you see Computational Thinking in your Twitter Account?

* Example touching our daily lives.
* When we look at any app or website today we are watching CT face to face.


## CT to Code
> Computational Thinking is the toolset we use when we translate our human ideas into precise instructions for a computer to carry  out. Those instructions are called **CODE**.

![](/assets/images/am-ct-intro/CT_Intro_Slides_9.png)
* The modern computers took over the old - group of women matemathicians-.
* Grace Hopper - Room of Parabolic Calculations - COBOL
* Because we use super fast computers to solve problems today, it’s the art of giving instructions to them through coding which has become a fundamental skill.


## Papert to Scratch

> The role of the teacher is to create the conditions of inventiveness rather than providing ready-made answers.

* Seymour Papert, a Jean Piaget alumnae invented first LOGO, a programming language to teach kids about MATH. 
* Later, one of his students Mitchel Resnick created Scratch, today’s standard to teach kids and adults how to code.
