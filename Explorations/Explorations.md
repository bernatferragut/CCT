# Explorations

**Introduction**

Explorations is a chance to explore short activities and give you a chance to discuss how these skills could be brought into your classroom.
Use the time to discuss with your peers and keep in mind that you will need to fill out a document at the end to indicate how the connections might be made in your specific teaching context.
