* **Add your question** - Double click on the white bubble to select the text and write your question.

* From the **Control** section, drag **if/then/else** block and add it to your code.

**Check the answer:**  From the **Operator** section, drag the hexagonal **comparison block with an equal sign** into the coding area and place it inside the blank spot between the “if” and the “then” of the **if/then/else** block.

* In the green **comparison** block, on the right-hand side of the equal sign, write one of the two possible answers.
* From the **Looks** section, drag two **say “Hello!” for 2 seconds** blocks into the coding area and place them between the branches of the **if/then/else** block.

* Change the text in the **say** block according to the comparison, for example, **“Good job”** for the correct answer and **“Try again!”** for the incorrect answer

* You are done! Test your code by clicking on your sprite 


## Extension

**Add more questions** to your quiz by connecting the same sequence of blocks to your code and changing the question and the associated answer to compare to.

**Change the sprite’s appearance** when the answer is correct.

From the **Look** section, drag the **switch to “costume1"** block and add it to your code.


From the Look section, drag a block **switch to “costume2”** in the bracket of the **if/then/else block** corresponding to the correct answer.

* Select your **score** variable in the drop-down list by clicking on the **arrow** on the right of the variable.

* From the **variables** section, drag **2** blocks **change “my variable” by “1”** to the coding area. Add one **change “my variable” by “1”** to each of the brackets of the **block if/then/else**. Select your **score** variable in the drop-down list by clicking on the **arrow** on the right of **“my variable”.**

* Update **change “my score” by “1”** score value to **“1”** for the correct answer and to “-1” for the incorrect answer.
