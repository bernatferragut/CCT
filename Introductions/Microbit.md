* Familiarity with the microbit environment and the Makecode platform
* Familiarity with the programming concept of sequencing 
* Similarities in Visual Block Coding between Scratch and Micro:bit platforms


**Materials:**: Makecode platform

## What is a Microbit?
>The BBC micro:bit is a mini-computer that can be programmed to do almost any task! It has a built-in accelerometer, radio transmitter, 5 by 5 LED display and two programmable buttons. 

Powered by a battery pack or by USB, the micro:bit is a powerful tool to teach programming in a fun interactive way that has limitless potential. Each activity here teaches different radio concepts using micro:bit, building off of the previous exercise(s) and is perfect for any level of programming experience.

Anything from a digital basketball game to passing secret messages or creating a musical instrument is possible with this device that fits in the palm of your hand.



## Makecode Platform Intro
> Introduction of the MakeCode Interface and its similarities with Scratch.

    TEACHER NOTES
    * Introduce the MakeCode Interface and show its similarities with Scratch
    * Similarites: block palette, simulator - stage, coding area

## Makecode platform code example
> Comments on some simple code to see how easy is to work with.

    TEACHER NOTES
    * Live code slowly
    * Encourage people to go on the platform and test the code themselves

**EXPLORE** 
> Using the Online Simulator

* Change the icons 
* Change the string for their names 
* Change shake trigger for A + B
* Make sure to mention all the sensors micro:bits have
* Show a where the tutorials are in the makecode platform 

## Download your Program
**1.** Connect your micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.

**2.** The micro:bit will show up as a drive called **MICROBIT**

**3.** On the Makecode platform, after creating your code, press the **Download** button in order to save your code.

    <source src="/assets/images/videos/A.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

**4.** Save it as a .hex file, which is a format that the micro:bit can understand.
Locate the downloaded file and drag it to the 'MICROBIT' drive to upload your code to the micro:bit.

    <source src="/assets/images/videos/B.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

**5.** Now you're ready to use your micro:bit! You can keep uploading new .hex files onto your micro:bit but each time you upload a new program the old one is deleted as the micro:bits can only store one .hex file at a time.
Note: The micro:bit can only store .hex files and will reject any other type of file that it receives.



## Reflection
* Do you understand properly the main differences between both platforms?
* Why would you choose one over the other in your classes?
